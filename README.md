## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Through this project, I learnt how to perform an API request using the Fetch method. I also learnt how to use the useState and useEffect react hooks and how to use them to display the API data.

### Continued development

With this project, I will continue to hone my JavaScript and React skills by taking on many more projects.

### Useful resources

- [FreecodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - They have wonderful resources that helped me to understand some things about the fetch API.
